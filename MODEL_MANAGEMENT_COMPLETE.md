class ModelManager:
    def save_whisper_model(self, model_name, model, tokenizer, training_metadata)
    def list_saved_models(self) -> List[Dict]
    def load_model(self, filename) -> Dict
```

### File Structure:
```
models/
├── whisper_hindi_baseline_20250928_235830.pkl
├── whisper_hindi_baseline_20250928_235943.pkl
