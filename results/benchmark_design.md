    #### 1. Conversational Speech (50%)
    - **Real-world conversations**: Phone calls, meetings, casual chat
    - **Code-switching**: Multilingual speakers switching languages
    - **Noisy environments**: Restaurants, streets, offices
    - **Multiple speakers**: Turn-taking, overlapping speech

    #### 2. Accent & Dialect Diversity (20%)  
    - **Regional accents**: Geographic variation within languages
    - **Social dialects**: Age, education, socioeconomic factors
    - **Non-native speakers**: L2 accents and pronunciation patterns
    - **Elderly & child speech**: Age-related speech characteristics

    #### 3. Domain Coverage (20%)
    - **Broadcast media**: News, interviews, documentaries
    - **Educational content**: Lectures, tutorials, presentations  
    - **Business communication**: Meetings, presentations, calls

    - **Disfluent speech**: Stuttering, hesitations, repairs
    - **Emotional speech**: Anger, sadness, excitement  
    - **Technical terminology**: Domain-specific vocabulary
    - **Low-resource languages**: Underrepresented languages

    ### Improvements Over Existing Benchmarks

    #### Beyond LibriSpeech
    - **Real-world noise** vs clean read speech
    - **Spontaneous speech** vs scripted reading
    - **Multilingual support** vs English-only
    - **Diverse demographics** vs limited speaker pool

    #### Beyond CommonVoice
    - **Professional annotation** vs crowdsourced quality  
    - **Conversation context** vs isolated sentences
    - **Controlled acoustic conditions** for fair comparison
    - **Standardized evaluation protocols**

    ### Adoption Strategy

    #### 1. Open Science Approach
    - **Free hosting** on Hugging Face Hub
    - **Creative Commons licensing** for broad usage
    - **Regular updates** with community contributions
    - **Transparent evaluation** with public leaderboards

    #### 2. Academic Integration  
    - **Conference partnerships** (Interspeech, ICASSP)
    - **Shared task competitions** at major venues
    - **University collaborations** for annotation efforts
    - **Student challenges** to encourage participation

    #### 3. Industry Engagement
