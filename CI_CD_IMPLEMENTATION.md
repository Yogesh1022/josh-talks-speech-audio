## 📋 **Test Structure Created**

```
tests/
├── conftest.py              # Test configuration & fixtures
├── test_audio_processing.py # Audio processing unit tests
├── test_model_evaluation.py # Model evaluation unit tests
└── pytest.ini              # Pytest configuration
```

## 🎯 **How to Use Your CI/CD Pipeline**

### **1. Automatic Triggers**
- **Push to main/develop**: Full pipeline execution
- **Create Pull Request**: Validation pipeline
- **Create release tag**: Release pipeline
- **Daily at 2 AM**: Automated health checks

### **2. Manual Triggers**
```bash
# Go to GitHub Actions tab
# Select workflow → "Run workflow"
# Choose options (full, quick, models-only)
```

### **3. Release Process**
```bash
# Create and push a release tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Or create release via GitHub UI
# Pipeline will automatically build and deploy
```
